## Technologies
1. JS
2. HTML
3. CSS

## Development Strategy
I started this project, by first creating a basic [wireframe](https://github.com/angelinejacob/Tic-Tac-Toe_Game/blob/master/TicTacToe-Wireframe.pdf). 

After creating this basic web design, I thought through an algorithm and filled my javascript file with pseudocode. 

## Algorithm


## Unsolved Problems
1. Currently, both users can choose the same token if they want to. 
2. There are no checks to see if all required fields (Player names & tokens) have been populated.

## Future Features
1. Build an Easy, Medium, and Hard AI Bot
2. Player tokens will be displayed next to their score
3. UI Updates
    * Make the UI more intuitive when it's a players turn
    * Make the UI more readable, with less going on in the screen
4. Include functionality so that two players can play from different machines
